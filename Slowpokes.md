# The Goods:
// How is the coffee? Is the cappuccino good? Is the food good? How expensive is it? 
## The Cap:
The cappuccino came out in a pretty yellow cup and saucer, it was good, and strong, I could really taste the espresso. I'm not a cappuccino nerd, but it was a pretty good cup of coffee.  

## The Food: 
I got the **Breakfast Biscuit**. It's a biscuit sandwich with bacon and scrambled eggs. It was good, but nothing special. It came with honey and spicy jam, which were interesting, but I wasn't a big fan of the jam, I think it was too spicy for me, and too me, tasted like they mixed siracha and raspberry jam.

# The Vibes:
// What kind of people go here? Are the baristas nice? Do they look like they enjoy their life, are they having fun, and are they cute? 
## The Atmosphere: 
The place is really nice. The vibe is that of the corporate hippie. It has the vibe of if a silicon valley programmer got fired, moved to houston and decided to open a coffee shop. It is cute, but in an almost commercial grade fashion. It's clean, and they have some really cute sloth mascots posted across the place. The music is fairly loud, but not too much so that it drowns out conversation, it's just loud enough that you can talk to your friend across the table, and not worry about the people at the next table easedropping into your conversation. 

## The People:
The people remind me of silicon valley types. They bring their dogs in, wear only flashy or grayscale name brand athletic wear. They bring their dogs and children into the shop, and sit on their IPads and sip their cappuccinos. Every once in a while, a  They perfectly fit the atmosphere.

# The QoL's:
// Is the Wi-Fi good? How does it work? Are there places to sit and work? If so, what kind? Is there adequate seating, and is there an outside seating area? 
// Where is it located? Is the area bougie as fuck, or do we need to make sure there are no valuables in the car? Is there parking and is it paid? 
## The Seating:
The seating is great, there are a variety of places to sit, ranging from large tables, to being able to sit the bar or being able to sit outside. The people who were there appeared to be more transitory, in that they seemed to move through, rather than stopping in. 

## The Wi-Fi:
The wifi wasn't great, it was slow, required me to log in, and for a while, the only internet I could access what their merch store. Even after I logged in, it was slow. Do not plan on streaming anything here. 

## The Parking:
Parking on the street appears to require a permit at first glance, and while there, we saw an angry looking rent-a-cop there. In order to park, I had to take my car into the parking garage, parking was $3.50, so, factor that into the cost of coming here. It's also just inconvenient to have to walk through a parking garage, and take an elevator to get to a coffee shop. 

# The Summary:
// How long did I spend there? How long would someone usually spend here? Could I give a score (in an entirely unscientific sense)?
